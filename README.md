# Rose
AI assistant

This is a short description of a project that I am working on to finish my studies at SDA Academy for the AI Engineer diploma:

I created an AI assistant with Python named Rose that is 99% controlled using only the voice.

## Main features:

  - A database that stores contacts.
  - Send emails or whatsapp messages only using your voice without anything opening. It takes milliseconds to send an email for example.
  - Type and open apps without touching the keyboard.
  - Different misc functions like setting an alarm, telling the time, telling jokes and so on.
  - Browse the internet and extract information from wikipedia, **again**, without touching the keyboard.
